\defn A topological space $X$ is \emph{path connected} if for every two elements $x$, $y\in X$, there exists a (path) \emph{continuous} map $\gamma\colon[0,1]\to X$ such that $\gamma(0)=x$ and $\gamma(1)=y$.

\prop A path connected space is connected.\marginpar{figure: $\gamma_x$} \\
\pf Fix an $x_0\in X$.  To each $x\in X$, fix a path $\gamma_x$ in $X$ \emph{joining\/ $x$ to\/ $x_0$}, i.e., $\gamma_x(0)=x$ and $\gamma_x(1)=x_0$.  The family
\[ \set{\gamma_x([0,1])}{x\in X} \]
consists of connected subsets of $X$.  The intersection is not empty ($x_0$ is there).  So $\bigcup_{x\in X}\gamma_x([0,1])$ is connected by the previous theorem.  But the union is equal to $X$. %\qed

The converse is not true.  The example\marginpar{figure: $X$}
\[ X = \set{(x,0)}{x\in\lopen{0,1}} \cup \set{\paren[\big]{\tfrac{1}{n},y}}{y\in[0,1]} \cup \brace{(0,1)} \]
as a subspace of $\R^2$ is that of connected space which is not path connected.  In fact $(0,1)$ and $(1,1)$ cannot be joined by a path in $X$.

\textbf{Topological Vector Spaces:}~Let $V$ be a real vector space.  Suppose that $\T$ is a topology on $V$.  We call $V$ a topological vector space if the linear structure and the topological structure are compatible in the following sense:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item Vector addition: $\underbrace{V\times V}_{\footnote{where $V\times V$ has the topology generated by $\set{G_1\times G_2}{\text{$G_1$, $G_2$ open}}$}}\to V$ is closed and continuous
\item Scalar multiplication: $\R\times V\to V$ is continuous \\
where the topology on $\R\times V$ is generated by $\set{G_1\times G_2}{\text{$G_1$ open in $\R$, $G_2$ open in $V$}}$
\end{enumerate}
\egs $\R^n$, $C[0,1]$ under the uniform metric defined by
\[ d(f,g) = \sup \set{\min(\abs{f(t)-g(t)},1)}{t\in[0,1]} \]
In a topological vector space over $\R$, a set $A$ is \emph{convex} if for all $x$, $y\in A$, the line segment joining $x$ and $y$
\[ \set{tx+(1-t)y}{t\in[0,1]} \]
is contained in $A$.\marginpar{figures: $A\subset V$}

\prop A convex subset of a topological space is connected and in fact is path connected.

\remark We have the theorem that $f\colon X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(G)$ is open for every open $G$.  If $\B$ generates the topology on $Y$, then it is sufficient to observe that $f^{-1}(B)$ are open for each $B\in\B$.  Example: $\R$ has the usual topology generated by
\[ \B = \set{\open{-\infty,a}\c\open{a,\infty}}{a\in\Q} . \]
Thus $f\colon X\to\R$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(\open{-\infty,a})$ and $f^{-1}(\open{a,\infty})$ are open (in $X$) for each rational $a$.
